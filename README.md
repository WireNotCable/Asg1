# Starbucks Website

Ngee Ann Polytechnic - Interactive Development (ID) Assignment I

#website live at : https://wirenotcable.github.io/Asg1/index.html

# Objective :

This is a starbucks website for users to buy Starbucksmerchandise.

# Design Process:

As a user, I am sometimes unaware of which things are clickable, so i decided to add hover effect to any clickable texts and buttons.

As a user, I want the website to be organised so that the website is viewed from the top to bottom.

As a user, I want to have similar colour schemes as starbucks for better relatability so i decided to make white and green the main colours of my website.
