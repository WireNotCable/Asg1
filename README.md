# Objective : 
This is a starbucks website for users to buy coffee and merchandise.

# Design Process:
As a user, I am sometimes unaware of which things are clickable, so i decided to add hover effect to any clickable texts and buttons.

As a user, I want to have a hierarchy level so that the website is viewed from the top to bottom.

As a user, I want to have similar colour schemes as starbucks for better relatability so i decided to make white and green the main colours of my website.
